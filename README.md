## My favorite series is The Walking Dead
*The Walking Dead is a post-apocalyptic horror series centered around a group of survivors navigating a world overrun by zombies, referred to as "walkers." The story begins with Rick Grimes, a former sheriffâ€™s deputy, who wakes up from a coma to find the world in chaos and searches for his family. As he reunites with his family and other survivors, they face constant threats not only from walkers but also from other human groups who have formed dangerous factions. The group travels from place to place, seeking safety and community, encountering moral dilemmas that challenge their humanity. Over time, they struggle to rebuild civilization, dealing with betrayal, loss, and the search for hope in a broken world.*
